# IMDB-movies-assignment
You have the data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. In this assignment, you will try to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python.   Write Python code to explore the data, gain insights into the movies, actors, votes, ratings and collections, and submit the code.
There are two .ipynb files in this repository . one of which contains codes and visualizations based on matplotlib and seaborn library whereas the other .ipynb file contains codes and interactive visualizations based on plotly.
